# OCR 0-9 Digit Recognition Project

This repository contains a project focused on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) specifically designed to recognize digits (0-9) using neural networks. The project is developed using Python, TensorFlow, Keras, and other essential libraries. The code and notebooks in this repository provide a step-by-step guide to building, training, and evaluating an OCR model.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a simple OCR system that can recognize handwritten digits. The system uses a neural network model trained on the MNIST dataset, which is a standard dataset for digit recognition tasks. The project is structured into several key components:

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Using the MNIST dataset, the images are preprocessed and normalized for training.
- **Model Architecture**: A neural network is designed with dense layers to classify the digits.
- **Training the Model**: The model is trained on the MNIST dataset with various hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and epochs.
- **Evaluation and Testing**: The trained model is evaluated on a test dataset to determine its accuracy and effectiveness.
- **Prediction**: The model is used to predict digits from new input images.

## Files in the Repository

- **OCR.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains the code for building, training, and evaluating the OCR model. This notebook provides detailed explanations and visualizations at each step.
- **ocr_0_9_project.py**: A script version of the notebook, generated for easy execution outside of the notebook environment. This script includes the complete workflow from data loading to prediction.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Setup and Installation
